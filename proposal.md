Project title
=============

Factors Associated with Mental Health

Motivation
==========

In this project, we want to apply what we learn in "Data Science I" to a dataset we interested in and get some useful and interesting results. Mental health becomes critical concerns in the society. All participants in the survey are mentally ill. We are interested in employeesâ€™ mental status in tech companies and non-tach companies.

Intended final products
=======================

After few weeks work, we hope that we can get a well-built website which shows our analysis of the dataset and conclusions. This website will including our data source and some pictures created from data which reflect results. We will also make a short video which explain how we get our data, how we analyze it and what results we get.

Anticipated data source
=======================

The original dataset is from [Open Sourcing Mental Illness](https://osmihelp.org/research/)

Planned challenges
==================

1.  Date is getting from survey and is untidy

The dataset we obtain is untidy. Screening through rows, some observation values are absolutely mistakes (like age = -1726). And regarding the gender identity, people use different definition of gender type (like some people think they are "something kinda of female").

1.  Incredible plot

We intend to draw a map which shows the geolocation of participants surveyed.
