# Import and tidy data

First, we should have a roughly understanding about this data.

```{r}
mentalhealth_2014_df = read_csv("./data/mental_health_in_tech_2014.csv") 
mentalhealth_2016_df = read_csv("./data/mental_health_in_tech_2016.csv") 
```

```{r}
summary(as.factor(mentalhealth_2014_df$Country))
```

```{r}
mentalhealth_2014_df = 
  mentalhealth_2014_df %>% 
  filter(Country == "United States") %>% 
  select(- Country)

summary(as.factor(mentalhealth_2014_df$tech_company))
```
