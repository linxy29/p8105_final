### Motivation


The purpose of this project is to apply the skills we learnt in “Data Science I” to access data in real world setting and preferably make some impact on a concerning public health issue. In this case, we choose to analyze the mental health data gathered from a online survey done by OSMI, and hope our report could promote workplace mental health awareness and be used as reference by job seeker while job haunting.

<br></br>

### Intended final products


After few weeks of work, we hope that we can get a well-built website which shows our analysis of the dataset and conclusions including but not limiting to the following questions:

1. Do mental health illness and attitudes towards mental health vary by geographic location.

2. How stronge is the association between family history and mental health illness or other predictors

3. Attitudes toward mental health VS attitudes toward physical health consequence

4. Do tech companies provide more or less mental health benefits compared to non-tech company?

<br></br>

### Data Source


The original dataset is from [Open Sourcing Mental Illness](https://osmihelp.org/research/)
