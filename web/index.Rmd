### About the project

Mental health is an emerging healthcare topics nowadays, 1 in 5 people have diagnosable mental health illness[https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-By-the-Numbers], and the number is still increasing. As all known, work-place stress can be a trigger of mental health disorder. Recently, tech jobs become one of the most appealing job to jobseekers for its notably high compensation. However, reward doesn’t come at no cost, tech jobs are listed in the 15th work career for your stress level[https://www.cheatsheet.com/money-career/worst-careers-stress-level.html/].In this project, we will use the data collected through Open Sourcing Mental Illness(OSMI) survey and looking into the mental health in tech industry. And access whether the size or the location of tech company is related to employee’s mental health status, whether people with certain mental health disorder are more likely to seek treatment than others, and if mental health treatment will have a positive impact on one’s work performance with visuals and statistical model.


###Data
The Data used in the project is from OSMI [https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-2016], which is gathered from an online survey, the variables of the dataset are the questions asked in the survey. In order to improve readability, we renamed the variables with more meaningful names, and recategorized people who answered other than expected, people who aged under 0 and over 120, or gender been “unicorn”, as “other”.

### Exploratory Analysis

In the exploratory analysis interface, we present four plots to show the general information about the participants of the mental health disorder survey in [flexdashboard](https://runanon.github.io/final.github.io/flexdash.html).

The first interactive plot describes the percentage of the people who response currently having mental health disorder for each state in the US. The size of the circle represents the number of participants who work in a technology company or have a tech role. According to the interactive plot, we found most participants with tech-related jobs are from the Tri-state area, like New York and Connecticut. The percentage of getting mental health illness for these areas is around  60% or above 50% while the situation in California is better. It could be external factors like sunshine or environment in California resulting in a lower percentage of mental health disease. To have a better understanding of factors relating to mental health disease, we should take a close look about the [Conditional Inference Tree](https://runanon.github.io/final.github.io/#result). The second interactive plot describes the mental health condition for different company sizes. 

Two bottom plots provide information about the most common mental health disorders. One plot presents whether people actively seek treatment for different mental health disorder. From the plot, people with personality disorder are less likely to actively seek treatment compared to people with Post-traumatic stress disorder.  The other plot elucidates the influence of different disorders on participants’ job which could be concerned by the company. This plot also compared the mental health illness’ interference on work when treated and when untreated. From the plot, we can observe the improvement for all kinds of disorders when people get treatment.   


### Intended final products


After few weeks of work, we hope that we can get a well-built website which shows our analysis of the dataset and conclusions including but not limiting to the following questions:

1. Do mental health illness and attitudes towards mental health vary by geographic location.

2. How stronge is the association between family history and mental health illness or other predictors

3. Attitudes toward mental health VS attitudes toward physical health consequence

4. Do tech companies provide more or less mental health benefits compared to non-tech company?
