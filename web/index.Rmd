### About the project

Mental health is an emerging healthcare topics nowadays, [1 in 5 people have diagnosable mental health illness](https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-By-the-Numbers), and the number is still increasing. As all known, work-place stress can be a trigger of mental health disorder. Recently, tech jobs become one of the most appealing job to jobseekers for its notably high compensation. However, reward doesn’t come at no cost, tech jobs are listed in the [15th work career for your stress level](https://www.cheatsheet.com/money-career/worst-careers-stress-level.html/).In this project, we will use the data collected through Open Sourcing Mental Illness(OSMI) survey and looking into the mental health in tech industry. And access whether the size or the location of tech company is related to employee’s mental health status, whether people with certain mental health disorder are more likely to seek treatment than others, and if mental health treatment will have a positive impact on one’s work performance with visuals and statistical model.

###Data
The Data used in the project is from [OSMI](https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-2016), which is gathered from an online survey, the variables of the dataset are the questions asked in the survey. In order to improve readability, we renamed the variables with more [meaningful names](Variable name.pdf), and recategorized people who answered other than expected, people who aged under 0 and over 120, or gender been “unicorn”, as “other”.

### Intended final products


After few weeks of work, we hope that we can get a well-built website which shows our analysis of the dataset and conclusions including but not limiting to the following questions:

1. Do mental health illness and attitudes towards mental health vary by geographic location.

2. How stronge is the association between family history and mental health illness or other predictors

3. Attitudes toward mental health VS attitudes toward physical health consequence

4. Do tech companies provide more or less mental health benefits compared to non-tech company?
